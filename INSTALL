oPOSSUM Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

Installation instructions for oPOSSUM. Please also see the DEPENDENCIES file
for a list of prerequisite databases, programs and libraries that are required
by oPOSSUM.

1) Install the oPOSSUM databases. There are currently five species databases
   and one database used for the TF cluster analysis:

	oPOSSUM3_human
	oPOSSUM3_mouse
	oPOSSUM3_worm
	oPOSSUM3_fly
	oPOSSUM3_yeast
	TFBS_cluster

   To download the databases from our servers see section below.

   Now you must create a user "opossum_r" with select privileges on the
   each of the databases, e.g.

    mysql> grant select on oPOSSUM3_human.* to opossum_r@'%'; (etc..)

2) For web-based oPOSSUM, set up symbolic links from your webserver htdocs and
   cgi-bin directories. For example if you have installed oPOSSUM in 
   /apps/oPOSSUM3 then assuming you are using the Apache server installed in
   /usr/local/apache you would use something like the following:

    $ ln -s /apps/oPOSSUM3/cgi-bin /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/oPOSSUM3
    $ ln -s /apps/oPOSSUM3/htdocs /usr/local/apache/htdocs/oPOSSUM3

   You may have to edit your apache config file (httpd.conf) to allow following
   of symbolic links and executing cgi-bin files, e.g.:
    <Directory "/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin">
        AllowOverride FileInfo
        Options FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI +Includes
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

   Alternatively, of course you could copy the oPOSSUM htdocs and cgi-bin
   directories directly into the apache tree.

3) For web-based oPOSSUM, create the following directories:
    htdocs/tmp
    htdocs/results
    logs

   Change the ownership of these directories to that of the user under which the
   web server runs (usually 'nobody' or 'apache') and/or make these directories
   at least read/write/executable to to that user, e.g:

       chown apache:apache htdocs/tmp
       chmod 700 htdocs/tmp

4) For web-based oPOSSUM, edit the configuration constants in the main web
   options file lib/OPOSSUM/Web/Opt/BaseOpt.pm to reflect your specific
   installation.

   Specifically,
   
   * edit the OPOSSUM_HOME constant to point to the top-level directory
     under which oPOSSUM is installed.
   
   * edit the WEB_SERVER_URL constant to point to the top-level URL of your
     oPOSSUM web server.
   
   * edit the WEB_SERVER_HOME constant to point to the top-level directory
     of your apache web server.
   
   * edit the JASPAR DB connection constants, JASPAR_DB_HOST etc.

   There are additional web and standalone oPOSSUM option files under 
   lib/OPOSSUM/Web/Opt/ and lib/OPOSSUM/Opt/ that may also require configuring
   for your specific installation.

   * edit the oPOSSUM DB connection constants, OPOSSUM_DB_HOST etc.
   
   It is also possible to edit other values in these files to reflect
   different default values for the oPOSSUM analysis.

5) Edit the htdocs/index.html file and change specific URL to refer to the
   webserver oPOSSUM is residing on.

6) Edit the htdocs/templates/master.html file and change specific URLs to
   refer to the webserver oPOSSUM is residing on.

7) Install the sorttable.js javascript file from
   http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable into the oPOSSUM
   htdocs/templates subdirectory.


Accessing/Downloading Wasserman Lab Databases
---------------------------------------------
The Wasserman lab maintains an ftp site at cisreg.ca.

The JASPAR database is available under:

	/pub/JASPAR/JASPAR_2010.sql.tar.gz

Some of the databases may be too large to maintain on the ftp site. In these
cases It's possible to dump them directly from the Wasserman lab DB servers
using the mysqldump facility, e.g.:

    $ mysqldump -h opossum.cmmt.ubc.ca -u opossum_r --skip-lock-tables oPOSSUM3_human > oPOSSUM3_human.sql

Note: you will probably have to use the --skip-lock-tables option to the
mysqldump command.

All oPOSSUM related databases are hosted on Wasserman lab servers have a
"read-only" (i.e. select privilege) user associated with them which does not
require a password. The databases and associated hosts/users are:

DB		Host			User
--------------	-----------		---------
oPOSSUM3_*	opossum.cmmt.ubc.ca	opossum_r
TFBS_cluster	opossum.cmmt.ubc.ca	opossum_r
JASPAR_2010	vm5.cmmt.ubc.ca		jaspar_r
