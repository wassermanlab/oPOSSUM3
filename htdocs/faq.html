  <h4>Q. I entered a list of genes into Human SSA and I noticed that several were excluded from the analysis. Why is this?</h4>
  <p>
  A. This can happen for several reasons. The background data set was built by extracting 
  all human/mouse ortholog pairs from Ensembl, determining the promoter region, aligning 
  the sequences and scanning the conserved portions within the promoter regions for putative 
  TFBSs. In many cases, strict one-to-one human/mouse orthologs were not defined. Out of the 
  orthologs which were defined, some did not align in such a way that the conserved promoter 
  region could be identified in a satisfactory way. These genes were therefore excluded from 
  the oPOSSUM background set. Additionally, not all genes in the set could be mapped in all 
  other gene identification schemas. In the latter case you could try entering your list of 
  genes using a different gene identification system, preferably Ensembl Gene ID.
