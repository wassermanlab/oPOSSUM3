  <h2><a name="description"></a>Description</h2>
  <p>
  	oPOSSUM is a system for determing the over-representation of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and
	TFBS families within a set of (co-expressed) genes or sequences generated from high-throughput methods, as
	compared with a pre-compiled background set. The input is a set of gene identifiers (or fasta formatted
	sequences for sequence-based oPOSSUM). Over-representation of either individual TFBSs or <a href="#tfbs_clusters">
	TFBS clusters</a> with similar binding profiles can be calculated. Two types of analysis methods are available:
	single site methods that look at each (cluster of) binding sites individually (<a href="help/help_ssa.html">SSA<a>
	and <a href="help/help_tca.html">TCA</a>), and anchored combination site methods that looks for over-represented
	pairs of (clusters of) binding sites (<a href="help/help_acsa.html">aCSA</a> and <a href="help/help_actca.html">aCTCA</a>).
	The system compares the number of hits for
	each selected TFBS (cluster) in the target set against the background set. Two different scoring measures of
	significance are applied to determine which sites are over-represented in the target set,
	<a href="#zscore">Z-score</a> and <a href="#fisher">Fisher score</a>. The results of the analysis are displayed
	in tabular form showing the relative rankings of the TFBSs according to the two scoring measures.
  </p>

  <br>
	
  <h2><a name="statistical analysis"></a>Statistical Analysis</h2>
  
  <p>
  Two statistical measures of over-representation are currently employed, a <a href="#zscore">Z-score</a> 
  and a <a href="#fisher">one-tailed Fisher exact probability</a>. 
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="zscore"></a>Z-score</h3>
    <p>
    The Z-score uses the normal approximation to the binomial distribution to compare the rate of occurrence of a 
    TFBS in the target set of genes to the expected rate estimated from the pre-computed background set.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
    For a given TFBS, let the random variable <i>X</i> denote the number of 
    <font color="blue">predicted</font> binding site nucleotides in the conserved non-coding 
    regions of the target gene set.  Let <i>B</i> be the number of predicted binding site 
    nucleotides in the conserved non-coding regions of the <font color="blue">background</font> 
    gene set.
    </p>
    <p>Using a binomial model with <i>n</i> events, where <i>n</i> is the total number of nucleotides 
    examined (i.e. the total number of nucleotides in the conserved non-coding regions) from the 
    co-expressed genes, and <i>N</i> is the total number of nucleotides examined from the background
    genes, then the expected value of <i>X</i> is <i>u</i> = <i>B</i> * <i>C</i>, where 
    <i>C</i> = <i>n</i> / <i>N</i> (i.e. <i>C</i> is the ratio of sample sizes). 
    Then taking <i>p</i> = <i>B</i> / <i>N</i> as the probability of success, the standard deviation 
    is given by <i>s</i> = sqrt(<i>n</i> * <i>p</i> * (1 - <i>p</i>)).
    </p>
    <p>Now, let <i>x</i> be the <font color="blue">observed</font> number of binding site nucleotides 
    in the conserved non-coding regions of the co-expressed genes.  By applying the Central Limit 
    Theorem and using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution with a continuity 
    correction, the z-score is calculated as 
    <i>z</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(<i>x</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<i>u</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;0.5)&nbsp;/&nbsp;<i>s</i>.
    </p>

  <h3><a name="fisher"></a>Fisher Score</h3>
    <p>
    The Fisher score is based on one-tailed Fisher exact probability. In contrast to the z-score,
	the one-tailed Fisher exact probability compares the proportion 
    of co-expressed genes containing a particular TFBS to the proportion of the background set 
    that contains the site to determine the probability of a non-random association between the 
    co-expressed gene set and the TFBS of interest.  It is calculated using the hypergeometric 
    probability distribution that describes sampling without replacement from a finite population 
    consisting of two types of elements. Therefore, the number of times a TFBS occurs in the 
    promoter of an individual gene is disregarded, and instead, the TFBS is considered as either 
    present or absent. Fisher exact probabilities were calculated using the R Statistics package.
	Negative natural logarithms of the probabilities are used as the Fisher scores.
    </p>

  <h2><a name="gene_vs_seq"></a>Gene-Based vs. Sequence-Based</h2>
  <p>
    High-throughput sequence profiling methods such as ChIP-Seq have resulted in a rapid increase
	in the number of potential regulatory sequences that need to to be analyzed. With data generated
	from these methods, researchers focus on sets of sequences likely to be bound by a TF, rather
	than a list co-expressed genes. As such data is optimal for TFBS over-representation analysis,
	the sequence-based oPOSSUM systems were implemented to take	as input a foreground sequence set
	and a background sequence set. Over-representation scores are calculated based on the TFBS motifs
	found in the supplied input sequences. In contrast to the gene-based oPOSSUM systems, no conservation
	filtering is applied to the input sequences; the entire set of submitted sequences is screened for
	TFBS motifs. 
  </p>

  <h2><a name="species"></a>Species</h2>
  Currently, gene-based oPOSSUM systems have been built for human, mouse, fruit fly, worm (nematode), and yeast.
  A number of species-specific differences exist that users need to be aware of.
  <ol>
	<li>Search region lengths differ for each species.
	<table class="sortable" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="400">
	  <tr class="table_title">
		<th>Species</th><th>Max. Upstream (bp)</th><th>Max. Downstream (bp)</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr class="table_text" align="right"><td>Human, Mouse</td><td>10,000</td><td>10,000</td></tr>
	  <tr class="table_text" align="right"><td>Fly</td><td>3,000</td><td>3,000</td></tr>
	  <tr class="table_text" align="right"><td>Worm</td><td>1,500</td><td>1,500</td></tr>
	  <tr class="table_text" align="right"><td>Yeast</td><td>1,000</td><td>Annotated 3'end of the gene</td></tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	<li>Worm oPOSSUM accounts for operon structures by restricting the search space to the regions flanking
	the annotated start position of the first gene in the operon. TFBS predictions made in the search region of
	the first gene are universally applied to all other genes in the operon. 
	<li>Yeast oPOSSUM does not have conservation filtering.
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="tfbs_clusters"></a>TFBS Clusters</h2>

  <b>Clustering of TFBS profiles based on TF family and matrix similarity</b>

  <p>
  Often, TFs of the same structural families share similar DNA binding profiles.
  If a given TF family has numerous member TFs with almost identical consensus
  sequences, oPOSSUM SSA and aCSA results can be dominated by the profiles for
  these TFs. To avoid this situation, we can condense the redundant profiles by
  clustering them together based on their matrix similarities. The degree of
  similarities among consensus sequences of the TFs can vary greatly depending on
  the TF family in question. Thus, profiles within each TF family (as
  annotated in JASPAR 2010) have been clustered according to their matrix similarity.
  </p>
  
  <p>For a detailed summary of the clustering process, please refer to the manuscript.
  As of April 2011, 250 profiles from the CORE collection and 184 from the PBM
  collection were included in the clustering process, along with the 4 profiles
  from the custom PENDING collection, resulting in 170 distinct clusters.
