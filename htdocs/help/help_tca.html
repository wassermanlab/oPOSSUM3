  <h3><a name="select_target"></a>Entering Target Data Sets</h3>    
  <p>
    Specify your list of target genes or sequences by either pasting them into
	the text box or using the file upload option.
  </p>
  <p>
	For gene-based analysis, the gene list should be separated by spaces, commas,
	semi-colons, colons, newlines or some combination thereof.
	  
	For testing purposes, pressing the <b>Use sample genes</b> button will paste
	a pre-defined set of test genes into the text area.
	
	Use the <b>Clear</b> button to clear the text area.

    You need to choose the type of gene ID from the drop down menu. The gene ID
	types available are:<br>
	<ul>
	  <li>Ensembl Gene ID
	  <li>EntrezGene ID
	  <li>RefSeq DNA/Protein ID
	  <li>EMBL (GenBank) ID
	  <li>Protein (GenBank) ID
	  <li>Uniprot/TrEMBL Acc.
	  <li>Uniprot/SwissProt Acc.
	  <li>Unigene ID
	</ul>
	Depending on the species chosen, other species-specific database IDs are
	available:
	<ul>
	  <li>HGNC Symbol (Human)
	  <li>MGI Symbol (Mouse)
	  <li>FlyBase Gene ID (Fly)
	  <li>WormBase Gene Public Name (Worm)
	  <li>WormBase Gene ID (Worm)
	  <li>SGD (Yeast)
	</ul>
	Please note that while oPOSSUM attempts to use many different ways
	of identifying genes, the difficulty in mapping between different gene
	identification schemes means that not every gene in oPOSSUM is represented in
	every scheme. Every gene in oPOSSUM has an Ensembl gene ID, so this is the
	recommended gene ID type.
  </p>
  <p>
	For sequence-based analysis, fasta-formatted sequences can be pasted into the
	text area or uploaded as a file. If you only have genomic coordinates for
	your sequences, please use the <a href="http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/" target="_blank">Galaxy
	service</a> from the UCSC. Optionally, you can provide the maximum confidence positions
	(MCP) for each sequence, which will be used in calculating the distribution of
	DistMCP values (refer to the main help page on DistMCP and KS scores).
	The positions should be in chromosomal coordinates, and in the same order as
	the input sequences. If this option is to be used, the input sequences must have
	chromosomal coordinates as their sequence IDs, in the format of:
	<blockquote>chrXX:start_position-end_position (e.g. chr1:10000-10500)</blockquote>
	The positions can be either pasted or uploaded as a file.
	If no MCPs are specified, the mid-point of each sequence will be treated as the
	MCP.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="select_background"></a>Entering Background Data Sets</h3>
  <p>
	For both gene- and sequence-based systems, the same restrictions apply
	as given in the Entering Target Data Sets section.
  </p>
  <p>
  	For gene-based oPOSSUM systems, the full background data sets were compiled by
	selecting genes from Ensembl which were considered to be well known, i.e. the
	"KNOWN" attribute was true and the genes had a gene symbol assigned (HGNC
	symbol for human, MGI for mouse etc.). Transcription start sites (TSSs) were
	assigned for each gene based on the core Ensembl gene TSS annotations.
	You can paste in the list of gene ID's to be used as the background data set, or
	upload a file containing the ID's. Alternatively, you can specify the number of
	random genes to be picked as the background data set, where the maximum number
	allowed is the number of genes annotated in the oPOSSUM system.
  </p>
  <p>
	The default setting for gene-based analyses is to use all genes in the oPOSSUM
	database as your background.  Alternatively, you can specify the number of genes
	to be picked randomly to be used as the background (default=5000) or provide
	your own custom background gene list. Choosing randomly selected background
	genes can reduce the required computation time compared to choosing the entire
	gene set if the number chosen is sufficiently larger than your foreground gene
	set. If you are performing multiple analyses, and you wish to compare the results
	between analyses, we recommend you use "all" or supply your own background so
	that the background is stable across analyses.
  </p>
  <p>
	For sequence-based systems, you can either choose a pre-defined background
	data set or supply your own. When choosing a background data set, it is important
	to ascertain that its GC composition closely matches that of the target data set.
	The pre-defined data sets include:
	<ul>
	  <li>Mouse fibroblast cells
	  <li>Mouse liver cells
	  <li>Mouse ES cells
	  <li>Mouse bone marrow cells
	  <li>Mouse combined cell lines
	</ul>
	Your own data sets can be pasted in or uploaded as a file.
  </p>
  <p>
	For sequence-based analyses, the default setting for the background selection
	is to provide your own set of control sequences.  Alternatively, one can choose
	to use one of the provided backgrounds; however, these are currently limited
	to mouse sequences, and as each background set has a specific nucleotide
	composition (indicated in the background name), the available background sets
	may not necessarily be good matches for your foreground sequences.  It is
	preferable to supply your own control sequences as you can control for the
	nucleotide composition of your sequence sets. There is an automatic background
	sequence generator that is currently undergoing beta testing (provided below
	the custom background box), which you can use to extract a background with a
	nucleotide composition comparable to your foreground sequences. When choosing
	the background, you should ensure that you have the same number (or greater)
	of sequences in your background set as in the foreground set.
	If you are supplying your own background sequences, you can again optionally
  provide the MCP for each sequence to be used in calculating the background
  PeakDist distribution. As before, the positions should be in chromosomal
	coordinates, and in the same order as the background sequences provided.

  <h3><a name="select_tfbs"></a>
    TFBS Cluster Selection Based on TF Families
  </h3>
    
	<p>TFBS profiles from the JASPAR CORE, PBM and PENDING collections were grouped
	according to their structural families and clustered within each family according
	to their profilie similarities. 170 TFBS clusters were formed in total.
    You can specify whether to use the entire set or a selected subset of the clusters
	by specifying which TF families to include in your analysis. No custom TFBS input
	is allowed, as this analysis relies on pre-computed TFBS clusters stored within
	the oPOSSUM system.
	</p>
    
  <p><hr noshade><br><a href="#top"><img src="../images/arrow-up.gif" align="right" /></a></p>

  <h3><a name="search_tfbs"></a>TFBS Cluster Search Parameters</h3>
  
	<h4><a name="conservation"></a>Conservation level</h4>
	<p>
	  For gene-based systems, conservation was determined by using phastCons scores
	  from the UCSC Genome Browser scoring above some minimum threshold and merging
	  these into conserved regions of minimum length 20 bp.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The conserved regions that fell within 10,000 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the predicted
	  transcription start site (TSS) were then scanned for binding sites using position weight matrice (PWM) models 
	  of transcription factor (TF) binding specificity from the <a href="http://jaspar.genereg.net/" target="_blank">JASPAR</a> 
	  database. These TF sites were stored in the oPOSSUM database and comprise the background set for the default analysis.
	  The background set was pre-computed with three levels of conservation filter. 
	  <ul>
		<li>Level 1 corresponds to non-coding conserved regions with a minimum phastCons score of 0.40</li>
		<li>Level 2 corresponds to non-coding conserved regions with a minimum phastCons score of 0.60</li>
	  </ul>
	  The default conservation level is 0.4 (level 1). If you want to be more restrictive
	  in your analysis, you can raise the conservation level to 0.6 (level 2). 
	</p>
	<p>No conservation filters are used for yeast oPOSSUM and sequence-based systems.</p>
	<p><hr noshade><br><a href="#top"><img src="../images/arrow-up.gif" align="right" /></a></p>
	
	<h4><a name="threshold"></a>Matrix score threshold</h4>
	  <p>
		TF sites are scanned by sliding the corresponding postion weight matrix (PWM) along the sequence 
		and scoring it at each position. The threshold is the minimum relative (percent) score used to report the 
		position as a putative binding site. For gene-based oPOSSUM the background sets were scanned using a minimum threshold of 75%.
	    The background TFBS counts were pre-computed using three threshold levels. 
	  <ul>
		<li>Level 1 corresponds to a minimum relative score of 75%</li>
		<li>Level 2 corresponds to a minimum relative score of 80%</li>
		<li>Level 3 corresponds to a minimum relative score of 85%</li>
	  </ul>
	  </p>
    <p>
      The relative score is computed from the raw matrix score as:<br>
      rel_score = (site_score - min_matrix_score) / (max_matrix_score - min_matrix_score)
	</p>
	<p>
	  The default threshold is 80%, which is a commonly used threshold for TFBS
	  analyses using PWMs. If you have prior knowledge of which TFs are of interest
	  for your analyses and what their properties are, you may change this threshold
	  based on that knowledge (between 75% to 100%). For instance, if the matrix
	  for a TF of interest has a low IC, then you will want to use a higher threshold,
	  whereas for a TF with a high IC, you might try using a lower threshold. A
	  threshold of 80% or 85% will generally provide you with satisfactory results,
	  but if you are uncertain, we recommend multiple analyses with various thresholds.
	</p>
	
	
	<h4><a name="up_down_seq"></a>Upstream / Downstream sequence</h4>
	  <p class="text">
		  For gene-based oPOSSUM analyses, this refers to the size of the region
		  around the transcription start sites (TSS) which was analysed for TF
		  binding sites. The maximum amount of upstream / downstream region used
		  to pre-compute the background is species dependent, as follows.
	  </p>

  </table>
  <p>
	Using one of the pre-defined search region levels will result in much faster
	computation than using custom search region lengths, as the oPOSSUM system can
	take advantage of pre-computed values stored in the database. The default levels
	were reasonable in terms of regulatory region lengths for the individual organisms.
	Alternatively, you can choose other pre-computed regions from the drop down
	list or specify your own custom region.  As the regions in the drop-down list
	are pre-computed, the analysis will complete relatively quickly. Custom regions
	are not pre-computed and thus take longer to analyse; if you don't remember
	to adhere to the max upstream and max downstream constraints, the system will
	limit the region for you.  
  </p>
  <p>
	We recommend that you perform several analyses, varying the selected search region
	level for each analyses.  Using mouse as an example, you might start with the default
	of 5,000/5,000 bp, and then examine how	the over-representaiton analyses change
	between shorter and longer search regions by comparing the results from
	2,000/2,000 bp and 10,000/10,000 bp for another.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Notes:</b><br>
    <ul>
    <li>In cases where the specified amount of downstream sequence extends beyond the annotated 3' end of a gene, the amount of downstream sequence searched is truncated at the annotated 3' end.
    <li>In cases of multiple TSSs for a given gene, search regions are applied to each TSS and, if overlapping, combined.
    </ul>
  </p>
	  
	<h4><a name="sort_by"></a>Number of results to display:</h4>

	<p class="text">You can specify the number of results to be returned. The default
	is to return all results, but you can specify to return only the top 5, 10 or
	20 results. You can also specify to return all results which score above a given
	Z-score and Fisher score threshold. In cases where anything other than the "All"
	option is specified, the top scoring results are based on which scoring method
	was chosen in the "Sort results by" section. Also, in those cases, those results
	that are not returned, are lost, even those results that scored highly in the
	other scoring measure.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We recommend using the default of "all results", as selecting less than "all"
	  does not increase the speed of the analysis. Once you have the results file,
	  you can manually filter the scores yourself.

	<h4><a name="sort_by"></a>Sort results by:</h4>

	by the total number of nucleotides in the searched regions of the included target set.
	</p>
    
	<h4><a name="zscore"></a>Z-score</h4>
	<p>
	The likelihood that the number of TFBS cluster nucleotides detected for the included target
	genes/sequences	is significant as compared with the number of TFBS cluster nucleotides detected
	for the background set. Z-score is expressed in units of magnitude of the standard deviation.
	</p>
    
	<h4><a name="fisher_score"></a>Fisher score</h4>
	<p>
	The probability that the number of hits vs. non-hits for the included target genes/sequences 
	could have occured by random chance based on the hits vs. non-hits for the background set.
	Negative natural logarithm of the probabilities are returned as the scores.
	</p>
	
	<h4><a name="fisher_score"></a>KS p-value</h4>
	<p>
	For sequence-based only. The probability that the distributions
	of TFBSs for a given TF from the maximum confidence positions are equal between
	the target and background sequence sets. TFs of interest should have low p-values.
