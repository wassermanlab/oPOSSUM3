  <h1>oPOSSUM Release 2.0</h1>
  <h3>September 20, 2007</h3>
  <p>At approximately 2:00 pm PST, a small update was made to the oPOSSUM database's pre-computed values for a few genes. This may slightly affect the z-score values you obtain when using the default analysis parameters, although it should not affect the relative rankings of the results. We apologize for any inconsistency this may cause with previous analysis results.</p>
