=head1 NAME

OPOSSUM::DBSQL::Analysis::CountsAdaptor - Adaptor for MySQL queries to retrieve
and store gene TFBS counts.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

$aca = $db_adaptor->get_AnalysisCountsAdaptor();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In order to facilitate fast retrieval of TFBS counts from the oPOSSUM database
several count sets were pre-computed using discrete values for PWM (PSSM)
thresholds, conservation levels, and upstream/downstream search regions.
This adaptor provides an interface to both the pre-computed counts as well as
the raw data used to compute counts and retrieves the information into a
OPOSSUM::Analysis::Counts object which can be passed directly to the
OPOSSUM::Analysis::Fisher and WormOPOSSUM::Analysis::Zscore modules.

=head1 CHANGE HISTORY

 AK 010/10/28
 - added arguments -operon_gene_ids and -has_operon to all variations of
   fetch_counts(), fetch_custom_counts(), and fetch_anchored_counts()
 - Now, if input gene ids contain operon genes, the counts from the first
   gene in the operon are duplicated for all other genes belonging to the
   same operon
   
 DJA 2010/10/26
 - added method fetch_anchored_counts

 DJA 2007/01/29
 - modified fetch_custom_counts method to call
   the new ConservedRegionAdaptor->fetch_length_by_upstream_downstream
   method to get the length directly instead of getting all the conserved
   region records with fetch_set_by_upstream_downstream and then calling
   the length method on them (more efficient???)

 Title    : fetch_anchored_counts

 Usage    : $tf_set = $ctfsa->fetch_anchored_counts(
                -gene_ids           => $gene_ids,
                -anchor_tf_id       => $tf_id,
                -tf_ids             => $tf_ids,
                -distance           => $dist,
                -conservation_level => $level,

                -operon_gene_ids    => $operon_gids
            );

 Function : For the given genes, fetch the counts of conserved TF binding
            sites which are proximal to (within the inter-binding distance
            of) the anchoring TF.
 Returns  : A listref of OPOSSUM::TFBSCount objects.
 Args	  : Integer gene ID and integer conservation level.
			operon_gene_ids		- hash with key = operon gene id, val = first
								  operon gene id. used to replicate the counts
								  for the first gene with other genes belonging
								  to the same operon
			has_operon			- indicates whether this species has operons
								  optional operon_gene_ids are specified
 AK's Question: no all gene ids option for this method?
