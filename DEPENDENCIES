oPOSSUM Dependencies
--------------------

The following software and databases are required by oPOSSUM3.

1) The bioperl library

   The bioperl library available at:
   	http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Getting_BioPerl

   oPOSSUM had been tested with 1.4.

2) The TFBS perl library

   This is available at:
   	http://tfbs.genereg.net

3) Perl modules

   The folowing perl modules must be installed:
	CGI
   	CGI::Application
	Data::Dumper
	DBD::MySQL
	DBI
	File::Temp
	Log::Log4perl
	Persistence::Object::Simple
	Statistics::Distributions
	Template

   These should all be available through cpan.

4) The JASPAR DB of transcription factor binding site profiles is required by
   oPOSSUM3. This may be downloaded from the Wasserman lab (see section below).

Accessing/Downloading Wasserman Lab Databases
---------------------------------------------
The Wasserman lab maintains an ftp site at cisreg.ca.

The JASPAR database is available under:
	/pub/JASPAR/JASPAR_2010.sql.tar.gz

It *may* also be possible to dump the JASPAR database directly from the
Wasserman lab DB server using the mysqldump facility. The database is hosted
on vm5.cmmt.ubc.ca. and has a "read-only" (i.e. select privilege) user
"jaspar_r" which does not require a password. Note: you will probably have to
use the --skip-lock-tables option to the mysqldump command.
