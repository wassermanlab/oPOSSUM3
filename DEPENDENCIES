oPOSSUM Dependencies
--------------------

The following software and databases are required by oPOSSUM3.

1) The bioperl library

   The bioperl library available at:
   	http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Getting_BioPerl

   oPOSSUM had been tested with 1.4.

2) The TFBS perl library is required.

   This is available at as a tarball at:
   	http://tfbs.genereg.net

   NOTE: The tar file DOES NOT contain the TFBS:DB:JASPAR5.pm module

   You can also browse the subversion repository at:
	http://www.ii.uib.no/svn/lenhard/TFBS/

   The easiest way then is to get the tarball, unzip it and then retrieve 
   the JASPR5.pm module from the SVN.


3) Perl modules

   The folowing perl modules must be installed:
	CGI
   	CGI::Application
	Data::Dumper
	DBI
	DBD::mysql
	File::Temp
	Log::Log4perl
	Log::Dispatch::File
	Persistence::Object::Simple
	Statistics::Distributions
	Template

   These should all be available through cpan.

4) The JASPAR DB of transcription factor binding site profiles is required by
   oPOSSUM3. This may be downloaded from the Wasserman lab (see section below).
   The DB is called JASPAR_2010.
   
   Create a mysql user, jaspar_r with select privileges on the tables in the
   JASPAR_2010 DB, e.g.:
   	mysql> grant select on JASPAR_2010.* to jaspar_r@'%';

Accessing/Downloading Wasserman Lab Databases
---------------------------------------------
The Wasserman lab maintains an ftp site at cisreg.ca.

The JASPAR database is available under:
	/pub/JASPAR/JASPAR_2010.sql.tar.gz

It *may* also be possible to dump the JASPAR database directly from the
Wasserman lab DB server using the mysqldump facility. The database is hosted
on vm5.cmmt.ubc.ca. and has a "read-only" (i.e. select privilege) user
"jaspar_r" which does not require a password. Note: you will probably have to
use the --skip-lock-tables option to the mysqldump command.

5) The R statistic package (http://www.r-project.org/)
